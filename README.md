This is a library for communicating with the Beacn Mic.

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This code directly modifies the on-board storage of the Beacn Mic. While it's been tested and made to be as safe as
is possible, it was derived from reverse engineering and thus may not be accurate.

This project is not supported by, or affiliated in any way with Beacn. For official Beacn software, please refer
to their website.

In addition, this project accepts no responsibility or liability for any use of this software, or any problems
which may occur from its use. Please read the LICENSE for more information.

### Notes
Currently, this doesn't support hotplug or any dynamic 'detection' of the beacn mic, it also can not work with 
multiple devices. It's entirely sync based, and doesn't have any special messaging yet, it will likely be improved
over time.
